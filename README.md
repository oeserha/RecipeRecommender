# RecipeRecommender

### Abstract

- Problem- Choosing what to cook is often frustrating—users waste time searching for meals that fit their preferences, dietary restrictions, and current cravings
- Solution- An intelligent recipe recommendation system that delivers personalized meal ideas based on user profiles, preferences, and real-time input
- How it works-
  - Vector DB with 500k+ embedded recipes with metadata
  - User information such as likes, dislikes, and allergies are collected
  - User requests are embedded along with user info to find recipes to recommend
  - Personalized Results are returned to the user


### New Service Used
